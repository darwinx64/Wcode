# Zcode

A texteditor using Xcode's private DVT frameworks.

## Why make Zcode?

I wanted to write [Ycode](https://github.com/asentientbot/ycode) in swift rather than have it in Objective-C, so I went ahead and did that for learning purposes.

## Build

1. Run `make package`
  - This will output to `packages`, drag it into `/Applications`
